I got **✨a lot✨** of positive feedback from my [Guide to creating animations that spark joy with Framer Motion](/posts/guide-animations-spark-joy-framer-motion/), and it's undeniable that this library has piqued many developers' interests in the world of web-based animations.

While I introduced in this previous post many of the foundational pieces that compose an animation, and how one can orchestrate multiple transitions very easily with Framer Motion, **I did not touch upon many of the more advanced features that this library provides**.

Ever wondered how to propagate animations throughout several components or to orchestrate complex layout transitions? Well, this article will tell you all about these advanced patterns and show you some of the great things one can accomplish with Framer Motion!

<Callout variant="info">

Like the [original blog post](/posts/guide-animations-spark-joy-framer-motion/), this article contains a series of interactive widgets and playgrounds with preset examples to allow you to apply the Framer Motion concepts we're about to see **without the need to set up anything**!

Let me know what you think about these examples, and whether they were helpful. Your feedback is super important and will help me do better for my future blog posts 😄!

</Callout>

## Propagation

One of the first advanced patterns I got to encounter when I tried to add some micro-interactions with Framer Motion on my projects is **propagation**. I quickly learned that it's possible to propagate **changes of variants** from a **parent motion component to any child motion component**. However, this got me confused at the beginning because it broke some of the mental models I originally had when it comes to defining animations.

Remember in [my previous blog post](/posts/guide-animations-spark-joy-framer-motion/) when we learned that every Framer Motion Animation needed 3 properties (props) `initial`, `animate`, `transition`, to define a transition/animation? Well, for this pattern **that's not entirely true**.

Framer Motion allows variants to "flow down" through **every motion child component** as long as these motion components do not have an `animate` prop defined. **Only the parent motion component**, in this case, **defines the** `animate` **prop**. The children themselves only define the behavior they intent to have for those variants.

A great example where I used propagation on this blog is the "Featured" section on the home page of this blog. When you hover it, the individual cards "glow" and this effect is made possible by this pattern. To explain what really is happening under the hood, I built this little widget below where I reproduced this effect:

<FramerMotionPropagation />

You can see that hovering (or tapping if you're on mobile) the card or even the label above it triggers the glow effect. _What kind of sorcery is this?!_
By clicking on the "perspective" button, you can see what happens under the hood:

1. There's an "invisible" motion layer covering the card and the label. This layer holds the `whileHover` prop which sets the variant "hover"
2. The "glow" itself is a motion component as well, however, the only thing it defines is its own `variants` object with a `hover` key.

Thus when hovering this invisible layer, we toggle the "hover" variant and any child motion component having this variant define in their `variants` prop will detect this change and toggle the corresponding behavior.

```jsx {2-9,13,17} title=Example of propagation pattern with Framer Motion
const CardWithGlow = () => {
  const glowVariants = {
    initial: {
      opacity: 0
    },
    hover: {
      opacity: 1
    }
  }

  return (
    // Parent sets the initial and whileHover variant keys
    <motion.div initial="initial" whileHover="hover">
      {/* child motion component sets variants that match the keys set by the parent to animate accordingly */}
      <motion.div variants={glowVariants} className="glow"/>
      <Card>
        <div>Some text on the card/div>
      </Card>
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```

<Callout variant="info">

You can check out the full code of a similar example by navigating to the [Card with glow effect on hover snippet](/snippets/2020-12-26-cardwithgloweffectonhover/) page.

</Callout>

Now let's apply what we learned about the propagation mechanism of Framer Motion! In the playground below you'll find a motion component with a "hover" animation. When hovering it, a little icon will show up on the right end side of that component. You can try to:

- **Modify the variant key** used in the motion component wrapping the button and see that now that it defers from what's being set by the parent component, the animation does not trigger and the button is not visible on hover.
- **Set an**`animate` **prop on the motion component that wraps the button** and see that it now animates on its own and does not consume the variant set by the parent on hover.

<AdvancedFramerMotionSandpack snippet="snippet1" />

## Animate components when they are unmounting

So far, we've only seen examples of animation being triggered either on mount or following some specific events like hover or tap. But **what about triggering an animation right before a component unmounts?** Some sort of "exit" transition?

Well, in this second part, we'll take a look at the Framer Motion feature that addresses this use case and also the one that impressed me the most: `AnimatePresence`!

I tried to implement some kind of exit animations before learning about `AnimatePresence`, but it was hacky and always required extra code to set a proper "transitional" state (like `isClosing`, `isOpening`) and toggle the corresponding animation of that state. As you can imagine, it was very error-prone.

```jsx title=A very hacky way to implement an exist animation without AnimatePresence
/**
This is mostly pseudo code, do not do this!
It's not good practice
**/

const MagicComponent = () => {
  const [hidden, setHidden] = React.useState(false);
  const [hidding, setHidding] = React.useState(false);

  const variants = {
    animate: (hidding) => ({
      opacity: hidding ? 0 : 1,
    })
    initial: {
      opacity: 1
    },
  }

  const hideButton = () => {
    setHidding(true);
    setTimeout(() => setHidden(true), 1500);
  }

  return (
    <motion.button
      initial="initial"
      animate="animate"
      variants={variants}
      onClick={hideButton}
      custom={hidding}
    >
      Click to hide
    </motion.button>
  )
}
```

On the other hand, `AnimatePresence` is extremely well thought of and easy to use. By simply wrapping any motion component in an `AnimatePresence` component, you'll have the ability to set an `exit` prop!

```jsx {5,15} title=Example of use case for AnimatePresence
const MagicComponent = () => {
  const [hidden, setHidden] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <AnimatePresence>
      {!hidden && (
        <motion.button
          initial={{ opacity: 1 }}
          exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
          onClick={() => setHidden(true)}
        >
          Click to hide
        </motion.button>
      )}
    </AnimatePresence>
  );
};
```

In the interactive widget below, I showcase 2 versions of the same component:

- the one on the left is not wrapped in `AnimatePresence`
- the second one, however, is wrapped

That's the only difference code-wise. But as you can see the difference is pretty striking!

<FramerMotionAnimatePresence />

<Callout variant="danger">

👉 **Something I discovered while writing this article**

To set the proper direction of the transition, left or right, depending on which button is pressed, I set a state while the user hovers the button which will change the direction of the transition accordingly (not the best implementation I know but it works 😄)
Despite this working perfectly on the example on the right, the one that uses `AnimatePresence`, you may have noticed that on the example on the left, the transition kicks in just by hovering one of the buttons.

It seems that `AnimatePresence` keeps track of which motion component is rendered at a given time and throughout state changes.

I still need to investigate the inner workings of Framer Motion for that, but, despite it being a surprise to me, this behavior makes sense given the use case.

</Callout>

We now have a new awesome tool to use to make our transitions even better! It's time it a try in the playground below:

- Try to remove the `AnimatePresence` component. Notice how this makes Framer Motion skip the animation specified in the `exit` prop.
- Try to modify the animation defined in the `exit` prop. For example, you could make the whole component scale from 1 to 0 while it exit. (I already added the proper animation objects commented in the code below 😄)

<AdvancedFramerMotionSandpack snippet="snippet2" />

## Layout animations

We now know how to:

- propagate animations throughout a set of motion components
- add an `exit` transition to a component so it can unmount gracefully

Those advanced patterns should give us the ability to craft some pretty slick transitions right? Well, wait until you hear more about how Framer Motion can handle **layout animations**!

<Callout variant="info" label="New!">

The subject of layout animations is pretty vast to say the least! Since writing and updating this part, I decided to write a dedicated blog post about Framer Motion Layout Animations: [Everything about Framer Motion layout animations](/posts/framer-motion-layout-animations/) which is a complete guide with lots of examples.

**The following part is still relevant** if you want a light intro to this subject, but don't forget to bookmark the complete guide for later 🙂!

</Callout>

### What is a "layout animation"?

A layout animation is any animation touching layout related properties such as:

- position properties
- flex or grid properties
- width or height
- sorting elements

But to give you a little bit more of an idea of what I'm talking about here, let's try to take a look at the playground below that showcases 2 versions of the same component:

- the first one animates `justify-content` property between `flex-start` and `flex-end` by simply using the patterns we only know so far: setting this property in the `animation` prop
- the second one uses a new prop: `layout`. It's here set to true to tell Framer Motion that a "layout related property", and thus by extension the layout of the component, will change between rerenders. The properties themselves are simply defined in CSS as any developer would do normally when not using Framer Motion.

<AdvancedFramerMotionSandpack snippet="snippet3" />

We can observe multiple things here:

1. The first example does not work, it looks here that Framer Motion can't transition between `justify-content` properties the same way you'd transition an opacity from 0 to 1 gracefully.
2. The second component however transitions as expected between the `flex-start` and `flex-end` property. By setting `layout` to true in the motion component, Framer Motion can transition the component's `justify-content` property smoothly.
3. Another advantage of the second component: it does not have as much of a "hard dependency" with Framer Motion as the first one. We could simply replace the `motion.div` with a simple `div` and the component itself would still work

<Callout variant="info">

I plan on revisiting some of the animations implemented on this blog and maybe convert them to proper `layout` animations to simplify the code. I'm pretty sure my `Header` and `Search` component could benefit from it since their animations are centered around layout/height changes.

</Callout>

### Shared Layout Animation

We now know what layout animations are and how to leverage those for some specific use cases. But what happens if we start having layout animations that span several components?

<Callout variant="info">

**Update November 2021**

After the release of Framer Motion `v5.0`, this section has been entirely rewritten, including the examples.

`AnimatedSharedLayout` has been deprecated in favor of a new and more performant way to handle shared layout animations.

You can read more details about this update in the [v5.0 migration docs](https://www.framer.com/docs/guide-upgrade/#50)

</Callout>

In the more recent versions of Framer Motion, building shared layout animations has been greatly improved: the only thing we need to do is set a **common** `layoutId` prop to the components that are part of a shared layout animation.

Below, you'll find a widget that showcases an example of shared layout animation.

<FramerMotionAnimationLayout />

When clicking on one of the emojis in the example above you will notice that:

- **the border will gracefully move** to the newly selected element when the common `layoutId` is **enabled**
- **the border will abruptly appear** around the newly selected element when the common `layoutId` is **disabled** (i.e. not defined or different)

All we need to do to obtain this seemingly complex animation was to add a prop, that's it! ✨ In this example in particular, all I added is a common `layoutId` called `border` to every instance of the blue circle component.

```jsx {17} title=Example of shared animate layout using the "layoutId" prop
const MagicWidgetComponent = () => {
  const [selectedID, setSelectedID] = React.useState('1');

  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li
          style={{
            position: 'relative'
          }}
          key={item.id}
          onClick={() => setSelectedID(item.id)}
        >
          <Circle>{item.photo}</Circle>
          {selectedID === item.id && (
            <motion.div
              layoutId="border"
              style={{
                position: 'absolute',
                borderRadius: '50%',
                width: '48px',
                height: '48px',
                border: '4px solid blue';
              }}
            />
          )}
        </li>
      ))}
    </Grid>
  );
};
```

<Callout variant="info">

In previous versions of Framer Motion, before `v5.0`, this kind of use case would have required the `AnimatedSharedLayout` component which is now deprecated.

On top of handling shared layout animations, this component also helped handle layout animations that affected each other. Today, if you end up in situations involving a lot of individual layout animations, you will need to "group" them with the `LayoutGroup` component.

See the example in the playground below to try it out!

</Callout>

It's now time to give a try at what we just learned! This last example **compiles all the previous playgrounds together** to create this list component. This implementation includes:

- using the `layout` prop on the `ListItem` component to animate reordering the list
- using the `layout` prop on the list itself to handle resizing gracefully when items are expanded when clicked on
- other instances of the `layout` prop used to prevent glitches during a layout animation (especially the ones involving changing the height of a list item)

You can try to:

- comment out or remove the `layout` prop on the `ListItem` and see that now, reordering happens abruptly 👉 no more transition!
- comment out or remove the `LayoutGroup` and notice how this affects all the layout animations
- try to add the `layout` prop on the `<Title/>` component and see it gracefully adjusting when the height of an item changes
