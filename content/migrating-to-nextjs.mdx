Last year, I gave myself the objective of [learning Next.js](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/learning-in-public/) as it was getting more and more popular among the people I followed on Twitter and was adopted by many companies as their main frontend framework. The focus of the Next.js team on **Developer eXperience (DX) and simplicity** was striking the first time I tried it, **especially compared to Gatsby** at the time which powered this blog and started to feel very cumbersome at times.

Thus in January, I told myself **I'd migrate over my entire blog and its content over to Next.js** and see if I could leverage its simplicity to make the experience of maintaining and expanding this blog easier and less time-consuming.

As this migration is now a success ðŸŽ‰ I wanted to dedicate this blog post to go through some of the thoughts I gathered throughout this process, and also the experience I had with both frameworks, to maybe help you choose what's best for your own setup.

<Callout variant="info">

I want to emphasize the fact that what I'm going to write about here is purely based on **personal experience and frustrations**.

My aim is not to delegitimize the value of one framework over the other ðŸ˜„. They both have their flaws, advantages, and use-cases where they shine the most.
