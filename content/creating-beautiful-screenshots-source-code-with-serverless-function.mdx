I was recently looking for ways [to automate sharing code snippets](https://twitter.com/MaximeHeckel/status/1263110355666046977), I thought that generating these code snippets images by calling a serverless function could be a pretty cool use case to apply some of the serverless concepts and tricks I've learned the past few months.
My aim here was to be able to send a file or the string of a code snippet to an endopoint that would call a function and get back the base64 string representing the screenshot of that same code snippet. I could then put that base 64 string inside a png file and get an image. Sounds awesome right? Well, in this post I'll describe how I built this!

## The plan

I've used [carbon.now.sh](carbon.now.sh) quite a bit in the past, and I noticed that the code snippet and the settings I set on the website are automatically added as query parameters to the URL.

E.g. you can navigate to [https://carbon.now.sh/?code=foobar](https://carbon.now.sh/?code=foobar) for example and see the string "foobar" present in the code snippet generated.

Thus to automate the process of generating a code source image from this website, I needed to do the following:

1. **Call the cloud function**: via a POST request and pass either a file or a base64 string representing the code that I wanted the screenshot of. I could additionally add some extra query parameters to set up the background, the drop shadow, or any Carbon option.
2. **Generate the Carbon URL**: to put it simply here, decode the base64 or get the file content from the payload of the incoming request, parse the other query parameters and create the equivalent carbon.now.sh URL.
3. **Take the screenshot**: use a chrome headless browser to navigate to the generated URL and take the screenshot.
4. **Send back the screenshot** as a response to the request.

## Foundational work: sending the data and generating the URL

The first step involved figuring out what kind of request I wanted to handle and I settled for the following patterns:

- Sending **a file** over POST `curl -X POST -F data=@./path/to/file https://my-server-less-function.com/api/carbon`
- Sending **a string** over POST `curl -X POST -d "data=Y29uc29sZS5sb2coImhlbGxvIHdvcmxkIik=" https://my-server-less-function.com/api/carbon`

This way I could either send a whole file or a string to the endpoint, and the cloud function could handle both cases. For this part, I used [formidable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formidable) which provided an easy way to handle file upload for my serverless function.

<Callout variant="info">

To keep this article short, I'm not going to detail much this part since it's not the main subject here, but you can find the code for handling incoming requests whether it includes a file to upload or some data [in the Github repository of this project](https://github.com/MaximeHeckel/carbonara/blob/master/api/carbonara.ts) if needed.

</Callout>

Once the data was received by the function, it needed to be "translate" to a valid carbon URL. I wrote the following function `getCarbonUrl` to take care of that:

```js title=Implementation of getCarbonUrl
const mapOptionstoCarbonQueryParams = {
  backgroundColor: 'bg',
  dropShadow: 'ds',
  dropShadowBlur: 'dsblur',
  dropShadowOffsetY: 'dsyoff',
  exportSize: 'es',
  fontFamily: 'fm',
  fontSize: 'fs',
  language: 'l',
  lineHeight: 'lh',
  lineNumber: 'ln',
  paddingHorizontal: 'ph',
  paddingVertical: 'pv',
  theme: 't',
  squaredImage: 'si',
  widthAdjustment: 'wa',
  windowControl: 'wc',
  watermark: 'wm',
  windowTheme: 'wt',
};

const BASE_URL = 'https://carbon.now.sh';

const defaultQueryParams = {
  bg: '#FFFFFF',
  ds: false,
  dsblur: '50px',
  dsyoff: '20px',
  es: '2x',
  fm: 'Fira Code',
  fs: '18px',
  l: 'auto',
  lh: '110%',
  ln: false,
  pv: '0',
  ph: '0',
  t: 'material',
  si: false,
  wa: true,
  wc: true,
  wt: 'none',
  wm: false,
};

const toCarbonQueryParam = (options) => {
  const newObj = Object.keys(options).reduce((acc, curr) => {
    /**
     * Go through the options and map them with their corresponding
     * carbon query param key.
     */
    const carbonConfigKey = mapOptionstoCarbonQueryParams[curr];
    if (!carbonConfigKey) {
      return acc;
    }

    /**
     * Assign the value of the option to the corresponding
     * carbon query param key
     */
    return {
      ...acc,
      [carbonConfigKey]: options[curr],
    };
  }, {});

  return newObj;
};

export const getCarbonURL = (source, options) => {
  /**
   * Merge the default query params with the ones that we got
   * from the options object.
   */
  const carbonQueryParams = {
    ...defaultQueryParams,
    ...toCarbonQueryParam(options),
  };

  /**
   * Make the code string url safe
   */
  const code = encodeURIComponent(source);

  /**
   * Stringify the code string and the carbon query params object to get the proper
   * query string to pass
   */
  const queryString = qs.stringify({ code, ...carbonQueryParams });

  /**
   * Return the concatenation of the base url and the query string
   */
  return `${BASE_URL}?${queryString}`;
};
```

This function takes care of:

- making the "code string" URL safe using `encodeURIComponent` to encode any special characters of the string
- detecting the language: for this I could either look for any `language` query param, or fall back to `auto` which and let carbon figure out the language.
- taking the rest of the query string and append them to the URL

Thanks to this, I was able to get a valid Carbon URL 🎉. Now to automate the rest, I would need to paste the URL in a browser which would give the corresponding image of it and take a screenshot. This is what the next part is about.

## Running a headless Chrome in a serverless function

This step is the core and most interesting part of this implementation. I was honestly pretty mind blown to learn that it is possible to run a headless chrome browser in a serverless function to begin with.
For this, I used [chrome-aws-lambda](https://github.com/alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda) which despite its name or what's specified in the README of the project, seems to work really well on any serverless provider (in the next part you'll see that I used Vercel to deploy my function, and I was able to get this package running on it without any problem).
This step also involves using [puppeteer-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core) to start the browser and take the screenshot:

```js title=Use chrome-aws-lambda and puppeteer-core to take a screenshot of a webpage
import chrome from 'chrome-aws-lambda';
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-core';

const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

/**
 * In order to have the function working in both windows and macOS
 * we need to specify the respecive path of the chrome executable for
 * both cases.
 */
const exePath =
  process.platform === 'win32'
    ? 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe'
    : '/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome';

export const getOptions = async (isDev) => {
  /**
   * If used in a dev environment, i.e. locally, use one of the local
   * executable path
   */
  if (isDev) {
    return {
      args: [],
      executablePath: exePath,
      headless: true,
    };
  }
  /**
   * Else, use the path of chrome-aws-lambda and its args
   */
  return {
    args: chrome.args,
    executablePath: await chrome.executablePath,
    headless: chrome.headless,
  };
};

export const getScreenshot = async (url) => {
  const options = await getOptions(isDev);
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch(options);
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  /**
   * Here we set the viewport manually to a big resolution
   * to ensure the target,i.e. our code snippet image is visible
   */
  await page.setViewport({
    width: 2560,
    height: 1080,
    deviceScaleFactor: 2,
  });

  /**
   * Navigate to the url generated by getCarbonUrl
   */
  await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'load' });

  const exportContainer = await page.waitForSelector('#export-container');
  const elementBounds = await exportContainer.boundingBox();

  if (!elementBounds)
    throw new Error('Cannot get export container bounding box');

  const buffer = await exportContainer.screenshot({
    encoding: 'binary',
    clip: {
      ...elementBounds,
      /**
       * Little hack to avoid black borders:
       * https://github.com/mixn/carbon-now-cli/issues/9#issuecomment-414334708
       */
      x: Math.round(elementBounds.x),
      height: Math.round(elementBounds.height) - 1,
    },
  });

  /**
   * Return the buffer representing the screenshot
   */
  return buffer;
};
```

In development, you'd need to use your local Chrome executable to run the function. I included in the repo the different paths for Windows and macOS to run the function locally if you want to test it out.

</Callout>

Let's dive in the different steps that are featured in the code snippet above:

1. Get the different options for puppeteer (we get the proper executable paths based on the environment)
2. Start the headless chrome browser
3. Set the viewport. I set it to something big to make sure that the target is contained within the browser "window".
4. Navigate to the URL we generated in the previous step
5. Look for an HTML element with the id `export-container`, this is the div that contains our image.
6. Get the `boundingBox` of the element ([see documentation for bounding box here](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v3.1.0&show=api-elementhandleboundingbox)) which gave me the coordinates and the width/height of the target element.
7. Pass the boundingBox fields as options of the screenshot function and take the screenshot. This eventually returns a binary buffer that can then be returned back as is, or converted to base64 string for instance.

## Deploying on Vercel with Now

Now that the function was built, it was deployment time 🚀! I chose to give [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) a try to test and deploy this serverless function on their service. However, there was a couple of things I needed to do first:

- Put all my code in an `api` folder
- Create a file with the main request handler function as default export. I called my file `carbonara.ts` hence users wanting to call this cloud function would have to call the `/api/carbonara` endpoint.
- Put all the rest of the code in a `_lib` folder to prevent any exported functions to be listed as an endpoint.

<Callout variant="info">

For this part, I'd advise reading in-depth [this intro to serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) on Vercel.

</Callout>

Then, using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#getting-started) I could both:

- Run my function locally using `vercel dev`
- Deploy my function to prod using `vercel --prod`

## Try it out!

You can try this serverless function using the following curl command:

```bash title=Sample curl command to call the serverless function
curl -d "data=Y29uc29sZS5sb2coImhlbGxvIHdvcmxkIik=" -X POST https://carbonara-nu.now.sh/api/carbonara
```

If you want to deploy it on your own Vercel account, simply click the button bellow and follow the steps:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <a
    style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }}
    href="https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/MaximeHeckel/carbonara"
  >
    <Button variant="primary">Deploy to Vercel</Button>
  </a>
</div>

Otherwise, you can find all the code featured in this post in [this Github repository](https://github.com/MaximeHeckel/carbonara).

## What will I do with this?

After reading all this you might be asking yourself: "But Maxime, what are you going to do with this? And why did you put this in a serverless function to begin with?". Here's a list of the few use cases I might have for this function:

- To generate images for my meta tags for some articles or snippets (I already do this now 👉 [Tweet from @MaximeHeckel](https://twitter.com/MaximeHeckel/status/1263855151695175680)
- To be able to generate carbon images from the CLI and share them with my team at work or other developers quickly
- Enable a "screenshot" option for the code snippets in my blog posts so my readers could easily download code screenshots.
- Many other ideas that I'm still working on right now!

But, regardless of its usefulness or the number of use cases I could find for this serverless function, the most important is that I had a lot of fun building this and that I learned quite a few things. I'm now definitely sold on serverless and can't wait to come up with new ideas.
